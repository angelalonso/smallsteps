# Small Steps
Pro Bono project from scratch

# Principles of development
- We will call each goal, object... an iteration.
- Each Iteration will be performed following the rules and methods defined here.
- The rules and methods are expected to be improved with each iteration. 
  - Past iterations will not be re-adapted to those better rules and methods.
  - If there is a need to have a past iteration re-adapted, a new iteration will be created based on that past iteration.
    - One example of an iteration that probably will need to be revisited is "defining a goal".
- Each iteration will go through 5 phases:
  - Conception.
    - Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time Based.
  - Planning.
    - A template will be filled up, to keep the whole iteration under control.
    - Special attention will be paid to scopes.
  - Execution and Control
    - Where the magic happens.
    - We join these two because right now we use one-guy teams.
  - Close.
    - Learnings, corrections for the future and follow-up iteration(s) brainstorming.

# Projects so far:
- Defining a Goal for this Repository.
- Defining what would motivate me.

# Next iterations proposed as of April 2021:
- First round of research on the current status on the fields that would motivate me.
- First basis for a starting point project. Precise details depend on previous iterations.

# Side projects that don't count as iterations
- Small, open, to-the-point project management tool.

# Small Steps
Pro Bono project from scratch

# Principles of development
- We will call each goal, object... iterations.
- Each Iteration will be performed following the rules and methods defined here.
- The rules and methods are expected to be improved with each iteration. 
  - Past iterations will not be re-adapted to those better rules and methods.
  - If there is a need to have a past iteration re-adapted, a new iteration will be created based on that past iteration.
- Each iteration will go through 5 phases:
  - Conception.
    - Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time Based.
  - Planning.
    - A template will be filled up, to keep the whole iteration under control.
    - Special attention will be paid to scopes.
  - Execution.
    - Where the magic happens.
  - Control.
    - This should be as automated as possible.
  - Close.
    - Learnings, corrections for the future and follow-up iteration(s) brainstorming.

# Next iterations proposed as of April 2021:
- Define a goal.
- Find similar tech pro-bono projects.
- Social IT projects and job openings search engine.

# Side projects that don't count as iterations
- Small, open, to-the-point project management tool.

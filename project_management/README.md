# Project Management System

Here I will define the tool(s) used to manage each iteration/project.

# Phases

The Project Management System will be present throughout the whole process.  

The tool so far is based on a Libreoffice Calc Spreadsheet. I chose that because it is open source and usable.

I will describe each part of the process by using the tool on a per-phase basis.

## Preparation

Create a folder and copy over Template.ods. You may want to rename it too.

Have a calendar of your liking ready: each task will need time allocated in your calendar. If something takes longer, you'll know that you have to move other tasks forward.

## Execution

Read the notes on each Sheet to have them filled up, in order, depending on the phase you are on.

The last Sheet is for learning points. Try to add your thoughts as you progress and don't wait until the end of the project.

# Why...

Classic Project Management tools are huge. Here I will describe why I discard some of those tools.

## Steering committee, Stakeholders...

So far I have no use for these elements. The first projects are handled by one person.

# Project Management System

Here I will define the tool(s) used to manage each iteration/project.

# Phases

The Project Management System will be present throughout the whole process.  

The tool so far is based on a Libreoffice Calc Spreadsheet. I chose that because it is open source and usable.

I will describe each part of the process by using the tool on a per-phase basis.

## Preparation

Create a folder and copy over Template.ods. You may want to rename it too.

## Execution

Read the notes on each Sheet to have them filled up, in order, depending on the phase you are on.

# Why...

Classic Project Management tools are huge. Here I will describe why I discard some of those tools.

## Steering committee, Stakeholders...

So far I have no use for these elements. The first projects are handled by one person.
